# go-callbag

This is an attempt to build [Callbag](https://github.com/callbag/callbag) protocol founded by [AndrÃ© Staltz](https://github.com/staltz) in golang.

> This type of coding in Go is very unusual and strange. Don't get discourage, the more you learn about Callbag the more you like it. Give it a shot.

At the moment the following functions have been implemented

- [x] Pipe
- [x] FromIter
- [x] ForEach
- [x] Map
- [x] Filter
- [x] Interval
- [x] Merge

Please take a look at example folder.

Cheers
